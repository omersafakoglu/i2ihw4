This assignment focuses on version management and bug fixing using Git. In the scenario, the product's r2.5.4 version is in production, r2.5.5 is set for future release, and r3.0 is under development. An error occurs in r2.5.4, prompting the creation of an r2.5.4.1 Bugfix branch. Changes made in this branch will be merged into both the future release and development branches. This exercise provides hands-on experience with Git and branch management.
